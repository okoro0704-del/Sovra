# SOVRA Protocol
## The World's First Autonomous Presence Layer

**SOVRA** (Sovereign Presence Architecture) is the world's first **Autonomous Presence Layer**  a self-regulating protocol that combines AI-powered human verification with blockchain-based sovereign identity and responsive token economics.

### The SOVRA Trinity

**SOVRA** is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **Sovereign**   
   Individual-owned data via SOVRN blockchain logic. Citizens control their identity, biometric attestations, and consent records through decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and cryptographic signatures.

2. **Verified**   
   AI-Powered PFF (Presence Factor Fabric) ensures real-world human liveness. Advanced neural analysis, texture detection, and rPPG pulse verification guarantee one person = one identity.

3. **Responsive Automation**   
   Smart Contracts trigger the instant minting and burning of SOV Units based on usage. The protocol autonomously adjusts token supply in response to verification events  no human intervention required.

### The Economic Rule: "Value through Vitality"

> **"As human verification events (Vitality) increase, the circulating supply of SOV decreases (Burn), ensuring the protocol's value scales with its utility."**

**How It Works**:
- **Vitality** = Human verification events (PFF scans, consent grants, identity proofs)
- **Minting** = New SOV units created upon verification (usage-based supply growth)
- **Burning** = 25% of all transaction fees permanently destroyed (deflationary pressure)
- **Result** = Higher usage  More burns  Reduced supply  Increased scarcity  Value appreciation

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with fixed inflation schedules, SOVRA's value is directly tied to real-world human activity. The more people use the protocol, the more valuable each SOV unit becomes.
